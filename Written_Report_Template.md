# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
This project is an analysis of a variety of Kickstarter campaigns. Performing an analysis on the given Kickastarter data will allow us to uncover trends between categories, subcategories as well as launch dates of campaigns and end dates. Looking at the financial goal amounts vs the pledged amounts will help determine the reasons for success or failure in a campaign.

### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis was to determine the different outcomes of each campaign based on the relationship between launch date and funding goals. This also includes creating visualizations of these outcomes. 

## Analysis and Challenges
To determine a thorough analysis tables and graphs that depict "Theater Outcomes Based on Launch Date", as well as "Outcomes based on Goals" will be used.
[Theater Outcomes Based on Launch Date](https://github.com/liligould/kickstarter-analysis/blob/main/Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch.png) as well as [Outcomes based on Goals](https://github.com/liligould/kickstarter-analysis/blob/main/Outcomes_vs_Goals.png) will be used.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Based on the Theater Outcome Table provided below much of the theater outcomes success came from the months of May and June. It also shows that although those two months were successful there was more campaigns in progress from April to August. To visualize this table even further it was turned into a line chart and as expected it shows that the peak of successful campaigns was in the month of May and June. Throughout the year it is good to see that there are consistently more successful campaigns then failed or canceled ones. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
The “Outcomes Based on Goal” chart shows that as the goal amount increased the success of the campaign was fewer and the failure was greater. This also could be because that the number of total projects decreased as the campaign goal increased. 

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
Some challenges I had while creating these visuals was setting the color. I wanted to set the color of the lines to match the Outcomes column in the Kickstart worksheet (successful=green, failed=red, canceled=yellow). I had to settle with different colors and reorganized the table order, in one case, so the colors made more sense for visualization. I also had trouble with adding the percentage sign to the “Outcomes Based on Goal” table.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
Two conclusions that can be drawn by the “Theater Outcomes Based on Launch Date” chart is that there were more campaigns in total between the months of April and August. The most success was seen in the months of May and June. With this in mind we can also say that because there was overall more success in May and June that there was a parallel of failures in those months as well. 
Another conclusion that can be drawn is that in the month of October there were no canceled campaigns. The difference between successful campaigns and failed campaigns was small and based on this we can suggest that a few of those campaigns could/should have been canceled.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
Because the “Outcomes based on Goals” chart shows that as the goal amount increased campaign success decreased and failed campaigns increased we can conclude that campaigns with financial goals between $15,000 and $34,999 failed more often. 

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
This conclusion does have some limitations however. For instance they could have been successful in some regards but the goal is just too hig. If they lowered the goal then they could more easily meet successful campaigns. A big error I see in this conclusion is that there could most definitely be more reasons for this outcome. 

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
Having a table or chart that includes the date launch could help determine a more concrete reason for the failures. Are people more willing to donate during a certain season?
