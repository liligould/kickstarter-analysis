# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends relating to categories, subcategories, as well as start and end dates. Analysed data from the US to see if these campaigns were successful or not. Looked at pledged and goal amounts as well to determine if these had any effect on the success or failure of a campaign.
